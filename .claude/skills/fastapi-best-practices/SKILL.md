# FastAPI Best Practices

Opinionated conventions for building production FastAPI applications. General Python idioms (naming, type hints, error handling, dataclasses) are covered by `modern-python-development` — this skill focuses on FastAPI-specific patterns.

## Quick Reference

### Async Routes

- `async def` — use ONLY with non-blocking `await` calls; blocks event loop otherwise
- `def` (sync) — use for blocking I/O; runs in threadpool automatically
- CPU-intensive — offload to Celery or multiprocessing, not threads
- Sync SDK in async route — use `run_in_threadpool()` from Starlette

See `references/async-patterns.md` for decision matrix, threadpool caveats, and examples.

### Project Structure

Organize by **domain**, not by file type:

```
src/
├── auth/                # Domain package
│   ├── router.py        # Endpoints
│   ├── schemas.py       # Pydantic models
│   ├── models.py        # DB models
│   ├── service.py       # Business logic
│   ├── dependencies.py  # Route dependencies
│   ├── config.py        # Env vars (BaseSettings)
│   ├── constants.py     # Constants, error codes
│   ├── exceptions.py    # Domain exceptions
│   └── utils.py         # Helpers
├── posts/               # Another domain
│   └── ...
├── config.py            # Global config
├── database.py          # DB connection
└── main.py              # App init
```

- Import across domains with explicit module names: `from src.auth import constants as auth_constants`

See `references/project-conventions.md` for full layout, DB naming, Alembic, and linting.

### Pydantic

- Use built-in validators (`Field`, `EmailStr`, `AnyUrl`) before writing custom ones
- Create a custom base model for consistent serialization across the app
- Split `BaseSettings` by domain — one per module, not a single global config
- Beware: `ValueError` in validators becomes a 422 response with the full message
- Response models are created twice — once by you, once by FastAPI for validation

See `references/pydantic-patterns.md` for base model template, schema design, and ORM mode.

### Dependencies

- Use for **request validation** (DB lookups, auth), not just DI
- Chain dependencies to compose validation without repetition
- Dependencies are **cached per request** — same dependency in multiple chains runs once
- Prefer `async` dependencies to avoid threadpool overhead on trivial operations
- Use consistent path variable names across routes for dependency reuse

See `references/dependencies.md` for chaining, auth, pagination, and DB session patterns.

### Database

- Table names: `lower_case_snake`, singular (`post`, `user`, `post_like`)
- DateTime columns: `_at` suffix; date columns: `_date` suffix
- Set explicit index naming conventions in SQLAlchemy metadata
- Prefer SQL-first — complex joins and JSON aggregation belong in the database

See `references/project-conventions.md` for index naming template, Alembic migration conventions, and SQL-first examples.

### Testing

- Set up an async test client (httpx + ASGITransport) from day one
- Mixing sync/async test patterns later causes event loop conflicts

See `references/project-conventions.md` for async test fixture setup.

### API Documentation

- Hide docs in production: set `openapi_url=None` for non-allowed environments
- Always set `response_model`, `status_code`, `description`, `tags` on endpoints

See `references/project-conventions.md` for docs configuration and endpoint documentation examples.
